Hi! Welcome to my website!

In this website I write about different things that interest me and free-time projects. My hobbies are rowing, reading, machine learning, programming with R, meeting with friends.

I like to learn new stuff so I created this website to exchange with others who have similar interests.
If you find something I wrote here interesting or have a remark, I`d be happy if you reach out to me.
