Hi! Wilkommen auf meiner Website!
Hi! Welcome to my website!

I am german but decided to write everthing here in english. My interests cover different topics where the online community consists mainly of english speaking people and thats why I am texting everything in english here.

I work as a data scientist in the steel industry. My hobbies are rowing, reading, machine learning, programming with R, meeting with friends.
