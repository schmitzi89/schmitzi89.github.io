# About me

Hi! Wilkommen auf meiner Website!

Hi! Welcome to my website!

I am german but decided to write everthing here in english. My interests cover different topics where the online community consists mainly of english speaking people and thats why I prefer to write in english. I hope that people with similar interests reach out to me.

I work as a data scientist in the steel industry. My hobbies are rowing, reading, machine learning, programming with R, meeting with friends.

This is me:
